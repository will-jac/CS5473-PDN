Problem 1:

Problem 2:

* Estimation of parallel computation time:
Serial Dot Product = K*M + (K-1)*A
Parallel Dot Product = 4*T+K/2*M+(K-1)/2*A

The parallel algorithm is faster than the serial algorithm if 4*T < (K*M + (K-1)*A)/2
This is because otherwise, 4*T >= (K*M + (K-1)*A)/2, which implies that 4*T + (K*M + (K-1)*A)/2 >= K*M + (K-1)*A, which is the runtime of the serial program
